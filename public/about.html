<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am a student web developer with a strong interest in building clean, responsive, and user-friendly web applications. I enjoy working with modern web technologies and continuously improving my skills in front-end and back-end development. Creating websites that are both visually appealing and functionally efficient motivates me to learn and experiment more.</p>
<p>As a student, I actively work on personal projects to strengthen my understanding of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic frameworks. I focus on writing structured code, improving performance, and ensuring good user experience across different devices. I believe that practical implementation is the best way to grow as a developer.</p>
<p>I am a quick learner, adaptable, and open to feedback, which helps me improve with every project I work on. My goal is to become a skilled full-stack web developer and contribute to meaningful projects while continuing my academic and technical growth.</p>
